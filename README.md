## Problem Statement

Have you ever come across the thin piece of folded paper that is part of every drug prescription box. Usually the text is in very small print and typically provides information about dosages, side effects, storage instructions and much more. They are hard to read and understand and requires some effort to get answers to common questions that you as a patient might have.
